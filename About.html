        <p>This game is for a Web Development Final Project in which members Randy, Meagan, Tiffany and Sabrina 
        created a game based on a version of Waterboy and Lavagirl we all played when we were younger 
        and enjoyed so much as kids. This game was developed as we reminisced our youth staying home playing simple
        video games that would give our home computers viruses. As well as playing gameboy games of shark boy and 
        lava girl on the gameboy, however these games were complicated and a lot of reading for the young mind so 
        the team wanted to make a game that was easy enough for people of all ages to play and succeed in. </p>
